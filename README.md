## What is this?
Intro here

## Why?
Set up situation

## How does it work?
Basic explanation of components

## Seems a bit cumbersome...
It is. 🤷‍♂️

But you set it up **once** and then it just works.

**And you no longer have to re-record todos manually by sending Telegram messages to @wipbot.** 😌

Disclaimer that [WIP Badge](https://wipbadge.com/) has upcoming feature for Trello integration to make this easier, (but until then this will suffice.)

## How long will it take to set up, and is it free?
* **5 minutes**. A little longer if you don't have a Zapier or WIP Badge account already.
* **Yes**.*

## Lets do it.
Sweet! Lets get started. 🛠️

### Step 1: Get a Zapier Account
( Already have one? **Boom** 💥 [Move to Step 2](#Step-2:-Blah) )
