### What is this?
A guide on how to **automatically sync your todos** from a list in [Trello](https://trello.com/) to a product in [WIP](https://wip.chat/).

<br>

### Why?
Many WIP makers use Trello to manage our todos. This means for each task we want to work on in the near future, **we need to record that todo twice**:
1. Create a new card in your todo list in Trello.
2. Send a chat message to [@wipbot](https://t.me/wipbot) using [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) (with the same info as the Trello card) to create the todo for your product in WIP.

**Setting up this automation will remove the need for Step 2 completely.** üôå

<br>

### How does it work?
You set create a [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) "Zap" and a [WIP Badge](https://wipbadge.com/) "Connection".
- The Zap will take each new Trello card and create a Github issue from it.
- The Connection will the Github issue and create a WIP todo for your chosen Product.

### Seems like a lot of moving parts...
It is. ü§∑

But you set it up **once** and then it just works.

Also, [@joelbaudin](https://wip.chat/@joelbaudin) is working on a Trello integration for [WIP Badge](https://wipbadge.com/) to make this easier, but until then this automation works just fine.

<br>

### How long will it take to set up, and is it free?
* **5 minutes**.
* **Yes**.

<br>

### Lets do it. üõ†Ô∏è

<br>

#### Step 1: Create a Github repo.
> Already have a WIP Badge connection set up? Skip to Step 4!

‚úÖ [Sign up here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) for a free Github account if you don't already have one.

‚úÖ [Create a new repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) (This will store your todos in between Trello and WIP).
 - This repo can be private if you have a paid Github account, but a public repo is fine if you have a free account.
 - Name the repo anything you like. For example, "MyProductTodos"

<br>

#### Step 2: Set up a WIP Badge connection.

‚úÖ [Sign up here](https://wipbadge.com/signup) for a free WIP Badge account if you don't already have one.

‚úÖ Enter and save your [WIP API Key](https://wip.chat/api) in your WIP Badge settings.

‚úÖ Follow the WIP Badge guide to [add a connection](https://wipbadge.com/guides) from your Github repo to your WIP product.

<br>

#### Step 3: Create a Zap from Trello to Github

‚úÖ [Sign up here](https://zapier.com/sign-up/) for a free Zapier account if you don't already have one.

‚úÖ [here](https://zapier.com/app/editor/template/563)

‚úÖ Click **Create this Zap**

<br>

#### Done! üèÅ

<br>

### Is that it?
Yep. Get back to work!

Continue making as you normally do, adding new todos to your Trello list.

Within 15 minutes, they **automatically appear in your product's todo list in WIP**.

<br>

### Why 15 minutes?
That's how often Zaps will check for a trigger (i.e. new Trello card). Which means usually your todos will appear in *less* than that time.

If you want to be able to make todos as complete just a few minutes after creating them, I recommend using the usual `/done` command with @wipbot in Telegram instead.
