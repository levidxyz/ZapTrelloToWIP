### What is this?
Intro here

### Why?
Set up situation
**...no longer have to re-record todos manually by sending Telegram messages to @wipbot.** 😌

### How does it work?
Basic explanation of components

### Seems a bit cumbersome...
It is. 🤷

But you set it up **once** and then it just works.

Disclaimer that [WIP Badge](https://wipbadge.com/) has upcoming feature for Trello integration to make this easier, (but until then this will suffice.)

### How long will it take to set up, and is it free?
* **5 minutes**.
* **Yes**.

### Lets do it. 🛠️

#### Step 1: Get a Zapier account.
> Already have one? **Boom** Move to Step 2.

#### Step 2: Create a Github repo.
> Already have a WIP Badge connection set up? Skip to Step 4!

✅ This can be a private repo if you have a paid Github account, but a public repo is fine if you have a free account.

#### Step 3: Set up a WIP Badge connection.
> Already have one? **Bam** Move to Step 3.

#### Step 4: Create a Zap from Trello to Github

✅ [here](https://zapier.com/app/editor/template/563)

✅ Click **Create this Zap**

**Done!**

### Is that it?
Yep. Get back to work. 🚧

Continue making as you normally do, adding new todos to your Trello list.

Within 15 minutes, they automatically appear in your todo list in WIP! 

### Why 15 minutes?
Well, thats how often Zaps run to check for a trigger (new Trello cards in this case). Which means usually your todos will show up in less than that time.

I wouldn't worry about it, unless you're creating super tiny *micro* todos that you're completing just a few minutes after creating.

#### Happy making!
