### What is this?
A guide on how to **automatically sync your todos** from a list in [Trello](https://trello.com/) to a product in [WIP](https://wip.chat/).

### Why?
Many WIP makers use Trello to manage our todos. This means for each task we want to work on in the near future, **we need to record that todo twice**:
1. Create a new card in your todo list in Trello.
2. Send a chat message to [@wipbot](https://t.me/wipbot) using [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) (with the same info as the Trello card) to create the todo for your product in WIP.

**Setting up this automation will remove the need for Step 2 completely.** 🙌

### How does it work?
You set create a [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) "Zap" and a [WIP Badge](https://wipbadge.com/) "Connection". The Zap will take each new Trello card and create a Github issue from it. The Connection will the Github issue and create a WIP todo for your chosen Product.

### Seems like a lot of moving parts...
It is. 🤷

But you set it up **once** and then it just works.

Also, [@joelbaudin](https://wip.chat/@joelbaudin) is working on a Trello integration for [WIP Badge](https://wipbadge.com/) to make this easier, but until then this automation works just fine.

### How long will it take to set up, and is it free?
* **5 minutes**.
* **Yes**.

### Lets do it. 🛠️

#### Step 1: Get a Zapier account.
> Already have one? **Boom** Move to Step 2.

#### Step 2: Create a Github repo.
> Already have a WIP Badge connection set up? Skip to Step 4!

✅ This can be a private repo if you have a paid Github account, but a public repo is fine if you have a free account.

#### Step 3: Set up a WIP Badge connection.
> Already have one? **Bam** Move to Step 3.

#### Step 4: Create a Zap from Trello to Github

✅ Click **Create this Zap**

**Done!**

### Is that it?
Yep. Get back to work!

Continue making as you normally do, adding new todos to your Trello list.

Within 15 minutes, they **automatically** appear in your todo list in **WIP**.

### Why 15 minutes?
That's how often Zaps will check for a trigger (i.e. new Trello card). Which means usually your todos will appear in *less* than that time.

I wouldn't worry about it, unless you're creating *micro* todos that you want to mark as complete just a few minutes after creating them.
